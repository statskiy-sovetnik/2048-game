## About

This is a web implementation of a well-known game `2048`.

I used `React JS` to render a 4x4 board and to update the score.

Animations of cells are slightly weird, but the purpose of the <br />
project was to practice `React`, so I didn't pay much attention to that.

I will upload the game on hosting as soon as possible.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
