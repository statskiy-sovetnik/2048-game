## About

This is a web implementation of a well-known game `2048`.

I used `React JS` to render a 4x4 board and to update the score.

Animations of cells are slightly weird, but the purpose of the project was to practice 
`React`, so I didn't pay much attention to that.

I will upload the game on hosting as soon as possible.

You can try the game yourself [here](http://2048-game.fun/).
